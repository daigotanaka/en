<p>I am writing this while I am having a breakfast at La PanotiQ cafe in Mountain
View.  I am listening to Episode 32 of Jerry Colonna’s Reboot podcast[^reboot].
He was discussing about personal values with two other guest Venture
Capitalists Bryce Roberts and Chris Marks. They talked about their VC
businesses, but the central question in this episode is essential also to
people in different businesses: “In my own work, what are my values? What are
my priorities? What would it mean to invest in being myself?” I enjoyed
listening their stories and felt I learned something from the people on the
other side of startup world.</p>
<p>On learning, Ivan Sutherland said, “When denied my minimum daily adult dose of
technology, I get grouchy.”[^sutherland]. I feel the same way. But honestly
speaking, it’s got so much tougher to keep learning everyday after we had a
baby. I can no longer “irresponsibly” sit at my desk to crave for knowledge
after I come home from work. There is food to prepare for her. There is bath.
There are diapers to change. I just don’t have time to quietly sit down
to open a book to read.</p>
<p>On an unrelated topic, I’ve been needing to upgrade my headphone. After seeing
Apple released Airpods, I wanted to try a wireless headset. I went to a
BestBuy store just opened nearby our house and found one [^insignia] sold at
$25. I tried them on at La PanotiQ for the podcast listening. Though this
product still has a cord between left and right earbuds, it was still a
liberating experience, not having to be tangled between the phone and the headset.</p>
<p>I went home from the cafe, and started to clean the kitchen. I listened to
another podcast.  I am not so much of a music person. I mostly want to use the
headphones to listen to podcasts and the dictations of books and articles. But
this is great. I can do boring tasks while I am learning something.</p>
<p>But I was not quite happy with the cord between left and right earbuds. I
shopped some more and found Rowkin headset[^rowkin] that came out not so long
ago.  This headset is really small. It’s so small and light that it does not
need a loop around the ear to prevent the fall. It just has to be lightly
pushed into the ear. I don’t think I would lose it on a light jogging
[^exercise].</p>
<p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5349/30236320921_4ffcc9b225_z.jpg" alt="rowkin"></p>
<p>After receiving Rowkin, I took my 1.5 year old daughter for a walk. She does
not care about me while she is on the stroller. So, I plugged the headset in.
I tried Instapaper’s “speak” feature to listen to a long New Yorker article
about Sam Altman [^altman]. The synthetic voice coming out from the Android
phone still sounds flat, but it’s much more listenable than some years ago. I
can live with it.</p>
<p>I’m now more committed to the idea of reading through the ears on the go. What
about books? English is a foreign language for me. I read a lot in English
at work. At the end of the day, my brain is too tired to read English writings
for fun. So, I have not been reading casually as much as I wish. Somehow
listening is much easier even in English. After watching “The Imitation Game”
[^imitation] on Netflix, I bought “Alan Turing: The Enigma” by Andrew Hodges
in Audible format on Amazon for the first time.</p>
<p>Each chapter in this Audible is about 25 minutes. It’s much slower pace than my
normal reading speed. But it probably come close when I am tired. And it’s
certainly easy to progress to the very end of the book at a steady and
predictable pace. I can finish it in little over a month if I listen 2 chapters
a day. Not bad for a 587 page book (when printed).</p>
<p>There are limitations of course. When I listen to web articles, I need to
choose the articles with fewer graphs and numbers. It’s suited more for good
stories on New York Times, New Yorker and so on. Rowkin’s battery lasts about
3 hours per charge. The lipstick-shaped case is a bigger battery that you can
recharge Rowkin on the go. This is enough for me if I listen during the train
ride to work, put it back in the case for charging at work and listen again on
the way home. The battery probably is not enough for heavy music listeners
[^stereo]. Bluetooth audio connection is mostly reliable for me, but sometimes
the connection does get interrupted. It’s an occasional irritation that should
be solved in the future version.</p>
<p>This may be changing my life style. Unlike radio, I get to choose exactly what
I want to listen to. The information flows into my mind through the ears from
such a small and wireless device. It makes me feel that I am injecting
knowledge directly into the brain.</p>
<p>The headset of course can be used for talking on the phone and for talking to
Siri or Google. With the device so discrete, I must look talking to myself.
That makes me wonder if one day we can “talk” without moving our mouth. That
would make us communicate like Ghost in the Shell both with humans and
machines.</p>
