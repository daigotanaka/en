### Be open and have hard conversations to achieve great things together

About a week ago, one of the product managers at
[FiveStars](http://fivestars.com) shared Sheryl Sandberg's post to Quora. It
was her answer to the question "How does one build a great company culture
across several locations in different timezones?" [^quora]. She started her
answer by writing,

> Facebook’s culture reflects our mission to make the world more open and
> connected. “Be open” has been one of our core values since the beginning.
> Our openness sets us apart and helps us move fast.

In order to get the work done and maintain its culture, Sandberg said the
people at Facebook have hard conversations, use their own product, and remind
themselves that their journey is only 1% done.

When I read this, I recalled a TED talk by Margaret Heffernan that I
watched earlier this year. It is titled “Dare to disagree”.

In the talk, Heffernan told the story of Alice Stewart who discovered that
pregnant women's exposure to x-rays could cause cancer of the children. Since
the publication of the preliminary findings in 1956, Stewart had to fight for
25 years before British and American medical establishments abandoned the
practice of X-raying pregnant women. Heffernan asks, "So, how did she know that
she was right?" She continues, "Well, she had a fantastic model for thinking."
Stewart's colleague statistician George Kneale actively sought disconfirmation
of her hypothesis through "different ways of looking at her models, at her
statistics, different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her."
Despite the big personality difference, they worked closely together until
finally Kneale failed to prove that she was wrong.

"It's a fantastic model of collaboration -- thinking partners who aren't echo
chambers. I wonder how many of us have, or dare to have, such collaborators.
Alice and George were very good at conflict.  They saw it as thinking." When
Heffernan said that, I had to stop the video and think for a moment if my
colleagues and friends are holding back their honest critisms to the ideas I
share just to be nice. I appreciate their friendship but I need to ask them
more than saying "good job" or "great idea" in order to forge my thoughts like
a Japanese sword hammered and heated by a master.

### How to have hard conversations when everybody is so...nice

Then I watched a video of the conversation between Reid Hoffmann and Michael
Dearing in the lecture series CS183C Blizscaling at Stanford
University[^hoffman]. They talked about how to use devil’s advocate to get
the real feedback to your startup idea (The part is at 33m 18s in the embedded
video below or follow this
[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vCdfa_aeI8&t=33m18s):

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vCdfa_aeI8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Hoffmann asks Dearing, "What are the indicators you would use for checking
the idea?" Dearing's first answer is to allocate a chunk of time in schedule
to exercise devil's advocate. "every big idea is going to be subjected to a
devil's advocate case. And somebody, probably the smartest person he could find
is gonna be in charge of trying to destroy your idea", he suggests. Clearly
assinging the devil's advocate role, the person in charge can address any flaws
in the idea without holding back. Another idea he showed is so-called
"pre-mortem". "Let's admit now that we failed. And let's forecast what it is
that would have gone wrong to cause our death." Dearing suggests this exercise
for listing the deadly risks upfront so that we have clear prevention or
mitigation plans.

Dearing's approach sounds great to me especially because I am surrounded by
decent friends and colleagues who are usually too nice to say brutal things to
me. At work, Dearing's tactics may work to avoid "groupthink",
the tendency of groups to go astray. In an article titled "Making Dumb Groups
Smarter" in Harvard Business Review[^sunstein], Professor Cass R. Sunstein
at Harvard Law School describes the big reasons for groups failing to
achieve the storied wisdom of crowds:

> The two main reasons for error are informational signals (some group members
> receive incorrect signals from other members) and reputational pressures
> (people silence themselves or change their views to avoid serious penalties)
> These two factors lead to four separate but interrelated problems: (1) Groups
> don’t merely fail to correct their members’ errors; they amplifythem. (2)
> They fall victim to cascade effects, following the statements and actions of
> those who went first. (3) They become polarized, taking even more-extreme
> positions than originally. (4) They focus on “what everybody knows,” ignoring
> critical information that only one or two members have.

At the end of the article, Sunstein shares tactics to avoid faulty
informational signals and reputational pressures getting in the way.
Appoiniting a devil's advocate is one of them.

### Don't let the real devil take over

This year, Amazon's workplace culture caught a big media attention when New York
Times published an article "Inside Amazon: Wrestling Big Ideas in a Bruising
Workplace". In the article, I learned that Amzon is practicing exactly what
Dearing and Sunstein suggested. Amazon's one of the 14 leadership principles
is "Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit". On the company web page[^amazon], it
explains what it means:

> Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree,
> even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction
> and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion.
> Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

The anecdotes in the article left me an impression that the employees generally
feel the co-workers are very smart and are determined to get the work done.  As
a customer, it is also believable to me that the rigorous scrutinization of
each idea is source of their dominating power against other retail competitors.
However, the story also suggests that their energy is often spent to rip every
idea and sabotaging each others instead of delivering values to customers.
I love using Amazon's service, but I definitely refuse to work there if the
anecdotes in the article reflect the general atmosphere of Amazon's workplace.
If more people feel like me, Amazon's culture may fail to attract and retain
talents. It may fall short of "Hire and Develop The Best", another one of thier
leadership principles.

Sunstein defends Amazon by saying that the brutal features of culture at Amazon
described in the article should be taken with many grains of salt and he
praised Amazon for its "indispensable guidance for companies both large and
small when they are deciding how to make group decisions."[^sunstein2]

### Sewing the seed of authentic relationship

How can we encourage disagreement without turning it as internal conflict and
disrespect? The question came out naturally as I finished writing the previous
paragraph. Luckily, I actually don't have to worry too much about it in my
team.

Authentic relationship is one of FiveStars's company values. It is amazing to
see the value is witnessed everyday in every part of the company especially
after the company grew to have over 300 employees in many offices in different
time zones. Because of the authenticity we have to each other, I am very
comfortable introducing devil's advocate as a framework to encourage being
critical to each idea. After every heated debate, I can see my colleagues
prefer to conclude the meeting with actionable items and commit themselves to
achieve the shared goal. We jokingly shared the article of "How to make sure
nothing gets done at work" on Fortune[^fortune] as the exact anti-pattern of
ourselves.

What was the source of this great culture we have? I've seen the co-funders
Victor (CEO) and Matt (CTO) both in good times and in tough times since the
company was too small for them to hide away from us (be it a single apartment
in Sunnyvale or a single-room warehouse office in Mountain View). There were
moments I felt the company was under tremendous pressures, but I never had a
moment that I doubted the friendship between the two. The rest of us learned
through the co-founders' attitude and care for each other. So we made sure that
we strived to build the same authentic relationship whenever a new member joined
the team.

FiveStars has the modern management practices such as objective key
results[^okr] to ensure everybody is working towards the common goal instead of
pulling each other's leg. It keeps the organization flat and communicating fast
across the functions with the cutting edge tools like Slack[^slack] instead of
email. But the tools and best practices would not be effective at all without
the great authentic relationship culture.

Sandberg said, "openness sets us apart and helps us move fast". In FiveStars
case, openness isn't a gesture from management to the employees. It is rather the
threads of one to one relationships being woven to the whole fabric.
