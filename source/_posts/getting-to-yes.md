### Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In

*Getting to Yes*[^getting-to-yes] was one of the books I had on my Kindle app
for years. I finally took time to finish over the year-end break. I recommend
everybody to read.

> "Getting to Yes offers a straightforward, universally applicable method for
> negotiating personal and professional disputes without getting taken and
> without getting angry."

*- from the book introduction on William Ury's web site.*

I didn't negotiate very much in my life. For many things from purchasing a car
to making an insurance claim, I simply thought there was no room for
negotiation. I also thought negotiation is always a stressful fight against the
other side of the table. But this book made me realize how I was blind from
many negotiation opportunities and how I was trapped in a misconception of
taking negotiations as positional bargains (I say I would buy a car with $8000
and she says she would sell at $10,000, and hopefully we agree on somewhere in
between.)

*Getting To Yes* taught me to focus on understanding each other's interests
instead of positions, and work together to solve the problem of
satisfying everybody's interests. Here is a clear illustration from the book:

> "...all too often negotiation end up like the proverbial children who
> quarreled over an orange. After they finally agreed to divide the orange in
> half, the first child took one half, ate the fruit, and threw away the peel,
> while the other threw away the fruit and used the peel from the second half
> in baking a cake."

If we focus on our positions (i.e. where to split the orange), we may be
ignorant of each other's underlying interests (eating the fruit and baking a
cake), ending our negotiation in a suboptimal agreement while we could fully
satisfy the interests of both parties. This example also illustrates a
counter-intuitive nature of negotiation: It is often the difference in the
interests that makes a creative solution possible.

The book also gave me a concrete measures on how much
negotiation power we have. Such measurement comes from BATNA, or Best
Alternative To Negotiated Agreement: "What options do I (and others) have if
this negotiation does not reach to an agreement?"

Finally, the authors reminded me that building relationship is the first step
before anything because we are negotiating with individual humans whether it is
a talk between a husband and wife or a talk of nations.

### How I negotiated to stay in USA when my visa was rejected

While I was reading, I thought of one of a few occasions in my life that I took
on a seemingly tough negotiation, and resolved in a creative way. After getting
Ph.D., I started to work for an oil field services company. It was the year
2007 when I needed to apply for a work visa (H1B) to continue working in USA.
The economy was just before the great recession, and the number of visa
applicants were very high. To everybody's surprise, my visa application was
rejected, saying that the field of study (Ph.D. in biodmedical engineering)
does not match the position in the company (a software engineer in an oil
company).

The company proposed that I should be transferred to their London office for a
year before I apply the visa again. I thought that was not acceptable because
it might damage the relationship with Yvonne, then my girlfriend,
especially under the circumstance that her father was very sick.

Since Yvonne and I were thinking to get married soon, I proposed the company if
they would pay the application and attorney fees in processing my green card
through our marriage. I thought this totally made sense because the company's
interest was to retain the productive employee, and cost of processing a green
card must have been lower than transferring someone internationally. It was me
and Yvonne's interest that I stay in USA, and avoid the big personal expense in
processing my green card through marriage. The company indeed favored my
proposal. Everybody's interest was satisfied, my green card process went
without any problem, and Yvonne and I are happily married forever since then.

### I will practice more

After reading *Getting to Yes*, the negotiation started to look like a fun
collaborative exercise rather than hostile talk among disagreeing people. It is
a process of collecting intelligence and solving problem creatively, rather
than playing a tug-of-war of positions. The outcome of the negotiation is also
greatly affected by one's emotional maturity to build firm relationship with
others so we can solve the problem together rather than seeing each other as
mere opponents.

It takes time to deepen the art of negotiation. Yet it is worth investing our
time to be better at it so we satisfy not only our lives but also on the other
side of the table. I will seek the opportunities to practice this art from now
on through out my life.
