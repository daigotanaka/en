In 1936 film "Modern Times", Charlie Chaplin comically but acutely criticizes
the pursuit of the industrial efficiency sacrificing the humanity. Chaplin
portrays himself as a factory worker who works in an assembly line of an ever
accelerating pace. He is a diligent worker and even obsessive in keeping up
with the demand by a corporate tyranny. The worker eventually loses his mind.

By the end of the last century, the kind of the task the worker was doing in
Modern Times became fully automated by machines. Today, machines are
becoming so intelligent that the intellectual tasks that were once considered
professional and complex are executed by artificial intelligence.
Those works include accounting, legal, and investment management.

People think the recent advancement of machine learning and its applications
will put many workers out of job.
[That is probably true](https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21700761-after-many-false-starts-artificial-intelligence-has-taken-will-it-cause-mass).
But the tasks the artificial intelligence is replacing the human worker is still
simple and repetitive ones: The kind exhausting and driving the factory workers
nuts.

Here is an example: A friend of mine in the data science community is applying
the deep learning to automatically categorize the fashion items in the
catalog. Currently, the workers with sufficient fashion knowledge look at
the photography of the merchandise, decide if it is a tank top or camisole,
then manually input the information into the database. Now the machine can
learn the pattern through the examples and become as good as a human worker.
The machine does not get exhausted or become mentally sick by repeating such
tedious work all day and night. And it works very fast.

Now fashion experts do not have to waste their time in those trivial tasks.
They can be engaged in more high-level and creative activities.
Yes, a worker would lose his job if all he wants to do is to perform a
well-defined, repetitive, and simple tasks. But shouldn't we rather be living
humanly by learning, creating, expressing, and loving?

Is it too optimistic if I say, "Machines will liberate human from inhuman
works."?

Of course, there are many concerns. The wealth will be highly concentrated in
the corporates and the capital who own the sophisticated machines. I also fear
the human workers replaced by machines would become hostile to the development
of the artificial intelligence. The 21st-century version of Luddite movement
may come into reality. The post-World War II system and the way of life must
change and the change is never comfortable to most of us. We will face a
big change in the social structure in every level before the real golden era
of man-machine collaboration flourishes.

But this is a chance that we prepare our future generation to live with the
updated definition of what it means to be a human and achieve something we never
thought we could.

"Many experts believe that human beings will still be needed to do the jobs
that require higher-order critical, creative, and innovative thinking and the
jobs that require high emotional engagement to meet the needs of other human
beings.", says Ed Hess in a
[Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2017/06/in-the-ai-age-being-smart-will-mean-something-completely-different).

If you are in early in the career, I bet your expertise will be challenged by
machine efficiency one day. How much portion of your job requires you to be
thinking critically and being creative? Does it require high emotional
engagement? In other words, does it make somebody smile and feel loved?

A theoretical neuroscientist Vivienne Ming even goes on to warn us that we will
turn from a human capital to a toxic asset if we don't invest in ourselves
today.
In [a Techonomy article](http://techonomy.com/2016/12/scene-from-an-office-2017-the-a-i-arrives/),
she writes, "It takes 20 years to a ‘build’ a problem-solver. It takes liberal
arts, and exposure to culture, and even learning to deal with repeated
failures. Instead, we train people with static skillsets to fill specific jobs.
All that misinvestment has turned human capital into a toxic asset."

Hess continues, "What is needed is a new definition of being smart, one that
promotes higher levels of human thinking and emotional engagement. The new
smart will be determined not by what or how you know but by the quality of your
thinking, listening, relating, collaborating, and learning. Quantity is
replaced by quality. And that shift will enable us to focus on the hard work of
taking our cognitive and emotional skills to a much higher level."

This applies even for a job like Data Scientist. Machines are automating
data science workflow every day. They are getting smarter. Today's data science
job requires a lot of manual work from data cleansing to the hyper-parameter tuning
of machine learning algorithm. That may keep our day full and we may think our j
ob is secure that way. But such tedious jobs will be replaced by computer
algorithms soon. In fact, as a data scientist, you should be the one who is
always thinking how to automate them so you can focus only on what matters.

In the era of the machine getting increasing smarter, I would like to focus on
the activities that make human smarter. Machine and human are different in
that machines need objectives defined by a human. They cannot envision the
future based on the human value system. Acquiring concrete skills to get things
done is important, but today's valuable skills may get obsolete tomorrow
and it may be replaced by what machine can do. Polishing our value system
within, envisioning the future, thinking critically to achieve our objectives -
I think those are increasingly important things to do every day as human.
